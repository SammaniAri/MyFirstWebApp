            The famous Backstreet Boys is an American vocal band that was formed
            in 1993. This is one of the most popular boy bands in the 90's. The
            band members are Nick Carter, Howi Dorough, Brian Littrell, Kevin
            Richardson, and AJ McLean. The band was just a group of ordinary
            singers up until 1996 when the band got fame due to their debut
            international album named Backstreet Boys. It is hard to deny the
            fact that the Backstreet Boys has been one of the top bands when it
            comes to American music.
